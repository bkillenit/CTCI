# CTCI Practice Problems

## Summary
I am currently reading Cracking the Coding Interview (6th ed.) and wanted to share solutions to the chapter challenges and interview questions along with chapter summaries with anyone doing the same or looking for a quick refresher on CS fundamentals. Please contribute your solutions via pull requests. I have included READMEs in each chapter's directory that summarize the concepts covered in that chapter.

The solutions are currently implemented in JavaScript ES6 but please contribute solutions completed in other languages.

**Have fun and happy hacking!**

## File Structure
Top level directories are named according to (chapter #)ch to make navigation via CLI faster. The leading character for each directory indicates which chapter's content can be found inside of it. For each chapter directory, there are solutions for the chapter's suggested challenges, a README that summarizes the chapter's concepts, and tests for each challenge coupled with a UI to display the results.

## Testing solutions
Tests for the chapter summaries are included, please use them as necessary. JavaScript implementations are tested with the Mocha framework. Tests can be executed by opening test.html in each chapter.

- TODO: include Mocha framework and HTML test.html for each chapter
